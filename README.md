# Fakebook
Hey, welcome to Fakebook! It's actually probably closer to Twitter in terms of functionality, but anyway... 
It's a lite-version, so you won't have EVERY feature you might have liked to see in a social media application, but it's still pretty neat! 

On the frontend its a React application, and authorization is done with auth0. Backend is in node, and the data is populated in mySQL. The frontend is hosted on Netlify and the backend on Heroku.

You can access the app here: https://fakebook100.netlify.app/

Take a look at the system design: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOL6c7bA=/?invite_link_id=402942657406
