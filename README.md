# Fakebook
Hey, welcome to Fakebook! It's actually probably closer to Twitter in terms of functionality, but anyway... 
It's a lite-version, so you won't have EVERY feature you might have liked to see in a social media application, but it's still pretty neat! 

## Tech stack
### Front end
On the frontend its a **React** application, and **vanilla CSS** (yep, just to prove that I can actually write it). 

State management is done with **Redux** (with the devtools) and middleware/side effects are conducted with **Redux saga**. 

The frontend is hosted on **Netlify**.

### Back end
The backend is in **Node.js**, and builds the server with **Express.js**. 

I'm using a **SQL** database (**mySQL**) to populate user, follower, and post data. 

The backend is hosted on **Heroku**. 

I'm also handling authentication and user management with **auth0**.
